              <p class="bodycopy">We have all spent time working as a part of a team. So we all have experience with projects grinding to a halt or workstreams hitting a wall.<br>

                It’s draining, frustrating and often confusing as to what, exactly, went wrong. We blame ourselves. And sometimes (if we haven’t had our coffee), we start pointing fingers.<br><br>
                
                But more often than not, the people are not the problem. The problem is how those people are working together.<br><br>
                
                That’s where Mural comes in. They know that good work only happens when you work well together. It’s why they designed a new platform and tools to make seamless, thoughtful collaboration easy for any team.<br><br>
                
                We’re grateful to have worked with the great people at Mural to craft a new strategy, tone of voice and design system. To support their transformation from a collaboration tool to a community primed to close the gap between ideas and impacts for teams everywhere.
